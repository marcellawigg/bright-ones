##Introduction

Bright-Ideas is a project involving jQuery primarily, for Turing School module 4. It's based on previous lessons on building and testing an API, using jQuery in your projects, and testing jQuery. I focused primarily on the backend aspect of this project, and thus the look of it is simple.

##Development

This project used Bootstrap framework for the front end, and a little Chai-Mocha for testing.

##Production
